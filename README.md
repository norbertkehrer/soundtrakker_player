# Amstrad CPC Soundtrakker Player in JavaScript

Back in 1991, Oliver Mayer (aka BSC) wrote Soundtrakker (https://github.com/BetaSoftCologne/soundtrakker), a cool music tracker for the Amstrad CPC. It was quite popular in the demoscene of that time. This is a little JavaScript player for music modules written in Soundtrakker 1.x to listen to songs from authors like BSC, Kangaroo, Tom&Jerry, and others, directly in your web browser. It uses ayumi.js the great emulator for the AY-3-8910 soundchip by Peter Sovietov (Javascript version by Alexander Kovalenko). You can find it here https://github.com/alexanderk23/ayumi-js

Try the CPC Soundtrakker player with more than 300 songs directly here: https://norbertkehrer.github.io/st_player/st_player.html

Have fun!
